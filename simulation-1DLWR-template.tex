\paragraph{Model presentation}
What is the model we want to simulate? What do we want to observe? Which is the state space and the dynamics?

\paragraph{Implementation}
Explain the structure of the code. Do not put necessarily all the code (not more than 100 lines) since some routines (functions) can hide efficiently some unnecessary complexity. Provide a code that run (and explicit librairies and dependencies). Ensure your file name is aligned with this part.

 \paragraph{Results}
 Explain the quantities you are studying (i.e. metrics and statistics). Provide good visualization.
 
\paragraph{Interpretation}
Relate these quantities to the model and to theoretical knowledge of the course.

 \paragraph{Conclusion}
 What have we learned? Is everything aligned (theory and practice)? What was difficult? Provide perspectives.
